# NUMBER GUESSING GAME USING C

1) In this game, the system will first generate a random number (say) "n".

2) It will then ask the user to guess the number.
      
      => If the user guesses a number higher than n the system will print "go lower", and
      
      => If the user guesses a number lower than n, the system will print "go higher".

      => If the user guesses the number correct, the system will print "correct!!" followed by the number of guesses it took user to reach the conclusion
