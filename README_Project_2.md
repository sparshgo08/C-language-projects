# Snake, Water, Gun

In this project I have created a simple C program for the game Snake, Water, Gun

Snake, Water, Gun or Rock, Paper, Scissor is a game that we all have played during school time.
We are preparing a C program capable of playing it with you.
The program should be able to print the output that is randomly generated (without knowing the user input) after you have chosen snake, water or gun.
